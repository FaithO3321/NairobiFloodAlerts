        <h1>Rivers</h1>
        <p>Nairobi's rivers are highly polluted, posing significant risks for waterborne diseases and flooding, particularly during the rainy season. Additionally, the city's sewer systems can contribute to flooding, especially when overwhelmed by heavy rains or when maintenance issues lead to blockages. Effective monitoring, regular maintenance, and infrastructure upgrades are crucial to mitigate these risks and protect the health and safety of Nairobi's residents.</p>

            <h2>Major Sewer Systems and Flooding</h2>
            <p>Besides rivers, Nairobi's major sewer systems can also contribute to flooding. Here are some key points:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sewer Overflow:</strong> During heavy rains, sewer systems can become overwhelmed, leading to overflow. This can cause sewage to mix with floodwaters, exacerbating flooding and increasing health risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Blocked Drains:</strong> Inadequate maintenance and solid waste disposal can lead to blockages in the sewer systems. Blocked drains prevent proper water flow, leading to localized flooding.</li>
                <li><strong>Aging Infrastructure:</strong> Nairobi's sewer infrastructure is often old and in need of upgrades. This can result in leaks and ruptures, contributing to flooding during heavy rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Combined Sewer Systems:</strong> Some areas have combined sewer systems that handle both sewage and stormwater. During heavy rains, these systems can become overwhelmed, leading to flooding and contamination of water sources.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>Please note that detailed data on water levels, pollution content, and flooding risk can vary significantly based on seasonal changes, urbanization, and other factors. Regular monitoring and updated assessments are necessary for more accurate information. Updates will be done continuously to inform residents about the potential of outburst.</p>
