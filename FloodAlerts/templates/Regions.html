        <p>These wards and estates, particularly the informal settlements and low-lying areas, were severely impacted by the recent heavy rains and flooding in Nairobi. The floods caused displacement of residents, damage to property, disruption of essential services, and increased health risks due to the potential spread of waterborne diseases.</p>

        <p>It is important to note that the flooding situation can vary based on the intensity and duration of rainfall, as well as the overall drainage infrastructure and preparedness measures in place.</p>

        <p><strong>Other new regions will be updated from time to time based on the amount of rainfall to capture new areas that could be flooded.</strong></p>
