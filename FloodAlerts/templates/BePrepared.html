        <h1>Be Prepared!</h1>
        <p>Floods can occur even when least expected. However, it is important to be prepared for such events. The following information can help endangered individuals to stay safe.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Flood Preparedness</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Know your flood risk: Understand if your area is prone to flooding by checking flood maps and historical data.</li>
                <li>Develop an emergency plan: Have an evacuation plan and designated meeting places for your family.</li>
                <li>Prepare an emergency kit: Include essential supplies like non-perishable food, water, first aid kit, flashlight, batteries, and important documents.</li>
                <li>Protect your property: Install flood barriers, clear drainage channels, and move valuables to higher ground.</li>
                <li>Stay informed: Monitor weather reports and flood warnings from reliable sources.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Safety Measures During a Flood</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Evacuate immediately if advised or if you feel unsafe.</li>
                <li>Avoid walking or driving through floodwaters, as it can be deeper and faster than it appears.</li>
                <li>If trapped in a building, move to higher floors or the roof.</li>
                <li>Avoid downed power lines and electrical hazards.</li>
                <li>Follow instructions from local authorities and emergency responders.</li>
                <li>Stay away from areas subject to flooding until authorities deem it safe.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Impacts of Climate Change on Flood Events in Nairobi</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased intensity and frequency of rainfall: Climate change is leading to more extreme precipitation events, increasing the risk of flash floods and urban flooding in Nairobi.</li>
                <li>Rising temperatures: Higher temperatures can contribute to more intense rainfall and faster snowmelt, exacerbating flood risks.</li>
                <li>Sea level rise: Although Nairobi is inland, sea level rise can impact coastal areas and potentially affect weather patterns inland.</li>
                <li>Urbanization: Rapid urbanization in Nairobi, coupled with inadequate drainage systems, can worsen the impacts of flooding.</li>
                <li>Deforestation: Loss of natural vegetation and wetlands reduces the capacity of the environment to absorb excess water, increasing flood risks.</li>
            </ul>
