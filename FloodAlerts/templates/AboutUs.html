                <h4>Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD)</h4>
                <p>Data Source: The primary source for weather forecasting and rainfall data.</p>
                <p>Methodology: Utilizes a network of weather stations across the country, satellite imagery, and advanced meteorological models to provide weather forecasts, early warnings, and seasonal predictions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Water Resources Authority (WRA)</h4>
                <p>Data Source: Monitors water levels in rivers, lakes, and dams.</p>
                <p>Methodology: Uses hydrological stations, gauging stations, and remote sensing technology to measure water levels, flow rates, and catchment conditions. This data is used to assess flood risks and manage water resources.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>National Disaster Operations Centre (NDOC)</h4>
                <p>Data Source: Collates information from various agencies and on-ground reports.</p>
                <p>Methodology: Integrates data from KMD, WRA, local authorities, and community reports to coordinate disaster response and issue alerts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Satellite Imagery and Remote Sensing</h4>
                <p>Data Source: Satellites such as those operated by NASA, ESA, and other space agencies.</p>
                <p>Methodology: Uses satellite imagery to monitor weather patterns, rainfall, river levels, and potential flood areas. Remote sensing technology helps in mapping flood extents and assessing the impact.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS)</h4>
                <p>Data Source: Provides global hydrological forecasts and monitoring.</p>
                <p>Methodology: Uses numerical weather prediction data and hydrological models to forecast flood risks up to 30 days in advance. GloFAS integrates meteorological data with river discharge and soil moisture information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Community-Based Monitoring</h4>
                <p>Data Source: Local communities and volunteer networks.</p>
                <p>Methodology: Community members provide real-time observations and reports on local weather conditions, river levels, and flooding incidents. This grassroots-level data is crucial for validating official reports and enhancing local responsiveness.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</h4>
                <p>Data Source: Combines various spatial data sources.</p>
                <p>Methodology: Uses GIS technology to analyze spatial data, model flood scenarios, and visualize flood risk areas. GIS tools help in mapping flood-prone regions, planning evacuation routes, and designing flood defenses.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Internet of Things (IoT) Sensors</h4>
